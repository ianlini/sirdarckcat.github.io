# Binaural Recorder experiment

This tries to merge multiple mics into one output on multiple channels.

Proof of concept works, but requires calibration. For calibration it could use gcc-phat (see /eear) to calculate the shift, and shift it for a sound that is in the center.

I'm not sure how accurate this will be, however as some of the sound will likely travel through the phone, so speed might be too fast to measure.
